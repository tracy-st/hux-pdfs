The research project interrogates an intellectual figure of foremost relevance to the emergence of architectural criticism in the United States. Born in New York in 1921, Huxtable trained as an art historian at NYU. In 1946, Philip Johnson hired her as an assistant curator in MoMA’s Department of Architecture and Design, where Alfred H. Barr was an important mentor. A Fulbright Scholarship allowed Huxtable to publish a groundbreaking text on Pier Luigi Nervi in 1960. In 1963, she was named the architectural critic at the New York Times, where, seven years later, she received the first Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Criticism. Huxtable was appointed to the New York Times Editorial Board in 1973 and remained in that post until 1982. The GRI acquired Huxtabel’s Papers in 2012. The GRI owns full records of the articles she wrote in various sections of the New York Times from 1963 to 1982. Huxtable left the GRI full copyrights of her Papers.
